Hook, professional intro
- Data Analyst & Independent Researcher 
- Passionate about finding ways that science & technology can reciprocally support well-being and autonomy, rather than facilitating and perpetuating extractive logics.
- Currently working as a Data Analyst with MMM helping develop long-term analytics programs which aim to support museum's missions by fostering autonomy and ownership over their data and project outcomes.

- Interested in HCI/CSCW, Data/Stats/ML, and Phil/Anth
- Trying to trace lines between UX-Stats-Data-Ethics.
- Data reflects a record, an observation, "what counts" (statistically and morally).
- Want to unpack how data and its use is not uncontroversial, and how can people reclaim use of such a thing?
- Always looking to learn more, I share on topics that I'm wading through over on my blog! [link to blog]
