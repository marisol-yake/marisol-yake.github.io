Welcome in! My name is Marisol (she / they) and my work is kin to a funky little pocket of science that is itself a collision of numerous fields of discipline: **Information Science**

To keep it brief, I care deeply about ensuring that implementations of technology or research **respect cultural and ethical boundaries**, and **that all of my practice reflects the values of reciprocity and autonomous engagement**, rather than fostering dependency.

----

**Organizations work because people do!** When people come together to accomplish a common goal, there's very little that can't be done. If not for the ability to communicate and cooperate effectively, it would be difficult to imagine the state and scale of things today. It doesn't take any project too long before there's simply too much information to hold exclusively in our heads, so we take notes and have discussions (both generating/processing data!) before further decisions are made.

With this in mind, in some sense, one could even think of an organization as a computing system! (a.k.a Socio-technical system) I prefer to take this perspective and use it to reflect organizational practice back onto itself for the benefit all of workers involved with the organization's data work. 

To betray the analogy for a moment, people aren't interchangeable cogs in a machine and I want to explore ways that research & technology can enhance quality-of-life at work and not deskill, surveil, and classify peoples. 

The core aim of my work is to extend the ability of tech and research to amplify the abilities of humanitarian workers, rather than impede them.

## What I'm Reading Right Now
- *Discipline and Punish (1975)*, Michel Foucault
- *Deaccessioning and Its Discontents (2018)*, Martin Gammon
- *Qu'est-ce la documentation? (1951)*, Suzanne Briet
- *Trait√© de Documentation (1934)*, Paul Otlet


<!--

Hook, professional intro
- Data Analyst & Independent Researcher 
- Passionate about finding ways that science & technology can reciprocally support well-being and autonomy, rather than facilitating and perpetuating extractive logics.
- Currently working as a Data Analyst with MMM helping develop long-term analytics programs which aim to support museum's missions by fostering autonomy and ownership over their data and project outcomes.

- Interested in HCI/CSCW, Data/Stats/ML, and Phil/Anth
- Trying to trace lines between UX-Stats-Data-Ethics.
- Data reflects a record, an observation, "what counts" (statistically and morally).
- Want to unpack how data and its use is not uncontroversial, and how can people reclaim use of such a thing?
- Always looking to learn more, I share on topics that I'm wading through over on my blog! [link to blog]
