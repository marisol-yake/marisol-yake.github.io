Welcome in! My name is Marisol (she / they) and I currently work as a Data Analyst and Museum-focused Data Educator. 

All of my work lives in a little pocket of science that is itself a collision of numerous fields of discipline: **Information Science**. It's where I get to to apply and share my experiences with UX Design, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Data Science, Programming, Philosophy, Anthropology, Sociology, History, and most recently Museum Collections.

To put it briefly, I care deeply about **ensuring that implementations of technology or research respect cultural and ethical boundaries**, and **that all my practice** reflects the **values of reciprocity and autonomous engagement**.

----

**Organizations work because people do!** When people come together to accomplish a common goal, there's very little that can't be done.

The core aim of my work is to extend the ability of tech and research to amplify the abilities of humanitarian workers, rather than impede them.

## What I'm Reading Right Now
- *Discipline and Punish (1975)*, Michel Foucault
- *Deaccessioning and Its Discontents (2018)*, Martin Gammon
- *Qu'est-ce la documentation? (1951)*, Suzanne Briet
- *Trait√© de Documentation (1934)*, Paul Otlet


<!--

Hook, professional intro
- Data Analyst & Independent Researcher 
- Passionate about finding ways that science & technology can reciprocally support well-being and autonomy, rather than facilitating and perpetuating extractive logics.
- Currently working as a Data Analyst with MMM helping develop long-term analytics programs which aim to support museum's missions by fostering autonomy and ownership over their data and project outcomes.

- Interested in HCI/CSCW, Data/Stats/ML, and Phil/Anth
- Trying to trace lines between UX-Stats-Data-Ethics.
- Data reflects a record, an observation, "what counts" (statistically and morally).
- Want to unpack how data and its use is not uncontroversial, and how can people reclaim use of such a thing?
- Always looking to learn more, I share on topics that I'm wading through over on my blog! [link to blog]
