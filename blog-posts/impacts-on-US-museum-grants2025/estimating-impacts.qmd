[*Write a snappy intro, thanks*]

In this post, we will be using a data science technique to get a feel for the financial impacts of the politically-charged targeting of federal grants for public, cultural institutions. Specifically, we will be estimating the impacts of these grant cancellations on Colorado Museums.

```{python}
#import pandas as pd
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#import seaborn as sns
```

```{python}
# Load IMLS Grants data, CO only
# Load NEH Grants data, CO only
```

```{python}
# How many records in IMLS grants?
# How many records in NEH grants?

# Proportions?
```

```{python}
# Bootstrap IMLS Grants - How many canceled?

# Bootstrap NEH Grants - How many canceled?

# Combine datasets
```

```{python}
# IMLS Grants Histogram + KDE, red vline [org] estimate
# NEH Grants Histogram + KDE, red vline ach estimate
# layout: (2, 1)

# Overall Impact Data Set
```
