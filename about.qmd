Marisol Yake is the Data Analyst for the Collections and Data Analysis (CADA) program at Mountain Museum Management, designing analytics software and reporting to help museum staff monitor their collections workflows lowering their overhead (staff and storage) costs.

A senior-year undergraduate student in Information Science with prior coursework in Finance. While studying Information Science at CU Boulder, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work alongside the caring folks in the [Philanthropics Informatics Research Lab (PIRL)](https://amy.voida.com/research-group/ "Link to PIRL website") as a research assistant under the guidance of [Dr. Amy Voida](https://amy.voida.com/ "Link to Dr. Amy Voida's website") and direct mentorship of [Dr. Shiva Darian](https://smdarian.github.io/ "Link to Dr. Shiva Darian's website"), contributing to a research manuscript exploring **how labor unions use data and information communication technologies (ICTs)** through the lenses of **Human-Computer Interactions (HCI)** and **Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**.

I always strive for my work to have tangible, lasting benefits for as many people in my local area as possible. My passion for learning has always been fueled by the idea that everything I've learned should be something that can go on to benefit others around me.

**People before profits** every time.
