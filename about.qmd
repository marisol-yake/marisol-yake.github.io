::: {#hero-heading}
Marisol Yake (she / they) is the Data Analyst for the **Collections and Data Analysis (CADA)** program working alongside Mountain Museum Management (MMM), designing analytics processes to best support museum staff in monitoring and intervening on their collections workflows, making space to find opportunities for increased data quality via quality-of-life changes to data work, and lowering their total overhead (staff and storage) costs.

A senior-year undergraduate student in Information Science with a minor in Philsophy, focusing on the philosophy of science. While studying Information Science at CU Boulder, I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work alongside the caring folks in the [Philanthropics Informatics Research Lab (PIRL)](https://amy.voida.com/research-group/ "Link to PIRL website") as a research assistant under the guidance of [Dr. Amy Voida](https://amy.voida.com/ "Link to Dr. Amy Voida's website") and direct mentorship of [Dr. Shiva Darian](https://smdarian.github.io/ "Link to Dr. Shiva Darian's website"), contributing to a research manuscript exploring **how labor unions use data and information communication technologies (ICTs)** through the lenses of **Human-Computer Interactions (HCI)** and **Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**.

I always strive for my work to have lasting, mutual benefits for all of our relations. My drive for learning and research has always been fueled by the idea that everything I've learned could be something that can go on to tangibly benefit peoples collectively.

**People before profits** every time.
